# `espace_bench`

Scripts to run [micro]benchmarks against
[espace](https://github.com/fredyouhanaie/espace).

This repo was part of the `espace` project, however, it has been
separated from the main repository in order to enable running
[micro]benchmarks against multiple versions of `espace`.

In addition to generating microbenchmarks, other `espace` application
benchmarks are also being included here. See the individual
directories for descriptions of the individual applications.

## micro-benchmarks/

These are a set of microbenchmarks that cover the `espace` API operations.

## pingpong/

This is the `espace` version of an old test.

## r3bench_utils/

These are a set of utility functions for handling benchmark data files
produced by the `rebar3_bench` plugin.
