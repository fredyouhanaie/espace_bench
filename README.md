# espace_bench

Scripts to run benchmarks against `espace`. This was part of the
`espace` project, however, it has been separated from the main
repository in order to enable running new benchmarks agains any/all
versions of `espace`.

Currently we use the `rebar3_bench` plugin, e.g.:

	$ rebar3 bench
	
In due course other methods will be added here.
